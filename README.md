## An initiative to build a security checkpoint mobile app for a local library
- The issue with the library security was keeping track of the laptops of library goers. They were tasked with asking people to log in their details such as the serial number of the laptop you would bring into the library. My aim was to make that process digital and for them to not use paper.
